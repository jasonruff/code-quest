# Scrum Implementation Guide for CodeQuest

This guide will help you implement Scrum for your educational coding game project, with practical steps tailored for a solo developer working with Claude and Claude Code.

## Setting Up Your Scrum Environment

### 1. Project Management Tool

While traditional Scrum uses physical boards, you'll want a digital solution:

**Recommended Option**: GitHub Projects
- Already integrates with your code repository
- Supports Kanban-style boards
- Can link issues directly to code commits
- Free and straightforward to use

**Setup Steps**:
1. In your GitHub repository, go to Projects tab
2. Create a new project using the Board template
3. Create the following columns:
   - Backlog
   - Sprint Backlog
   - In Progress
   - Review/Testing
   - Done
4. Import your initial product backlog items as cards

### 2. Time Management

For solo development, time-boxing is crucial:

- Set fixed work periods (e.g., 25-minute Pomodoro sessions)
- Schedule daily "stand-up" reflection time (even if just 5 minutes)
- Block specific time for sprint planning and review
- Use calendar reminders for Scrum events

## Adapting Scrum Events for Solo Development

### Sprint Planning

**Duration**: 1-2 hours at the start of each sprint

**Process**:
1. Review the product backlog
2. Select items for the sprint based on priority and estimated effort
3. Break down selected items into technical tasks
4. Create GitHub issues for each task
5. Move selected items to Sprint Backlog column

**With Claude**:
- Use the Sprint Planning template we created
- Share your thoughts on priorities and concerns
- Ask Claude to help identify risks or dependencies you might have missed

### Daily Scrum

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes daily

**Process**:
1. Review what you accomplished yesterday
2. Plan what you'll work on today
3. Identify any blockers or challenges
4. Update task status in GitHub Projects

**With Claude**:
- Use the Daily Scrum template in conversations
- Share your progress and challenges
- Ask for suggestions on any blockers

### Sprint Review

**Duration**: 30-60 minutes at the end of each sprint

**Process**:
1. Demo completed features to yourself (record for future reference)
2. Evaluate what was completed versus planned
3. Update GitHub issues with results
4. Document lessons learned

**With Claude**:
- Share your demo results using the Sprint Review template
- Discuss what went well and what didn't
- Get feedback on completed features

### Sprint Retrospective

**Duration**: 30 minutes at the end of each sprint

**Process**:
1. Reflect on the sprint process itself
2. Identify what worked well and what could improve
3. Create actionable improvements for next sprint

**With Claude**:
- Use the Retrospective template to guide your reflection
- Be honest about challenges faced
- Brainstorm process improvements

## Working with Claude and Claude Code in Scrum

### Claude as Product Owner Assistant

In Scrum, you'll primarily be the Product Owner, but Claude can help:

- Refine user stories and acceptance criteria
- Prioritize backlog items
- Ensure technical decisions align with product vision
- Provide objective perspective on feature value

### Claude as Technical Advisor

During implementation:

- Use strategy sessions with Claude to plan architecture
- Document decisions and rationale
- Create technical specifications for Claude Code

### Claude Code as Implementation Partner

For execution:

1. Create detailed specifications using the Claude Code templates
2. Focus requests on specific user stories or tasks
3. Review generated code against acceptance criteria
4. Document any adjustments needed

## Sprint Artifacts Management

### Sprint Backlog

- Keep in GitHub Projects
- Update daily with progress
- Add detailed comments to tasks as you work

### Sprint Burndown Chart

- Create a simple spreadsheet to track story points remaining
- Update at the end of each day
- Use to forecast completion and identify if you're falling behind

### Definition of Done Checklist

- Use the template we created
- Apply to every completed task before moving to Done
- Be strict about quality standards even when working solo

## Tips for Solo Scrum Success

1. **Be Disciplined**: Without a team to hold you accountable, you must enforce Scrum practices yourself.

2. **Time-Box Strictly**: Set alarms for the end of work sessions.

3. **Externalize Thinking**: Talk through problems out loud or write them down.

4. **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge completed work to maintain motivation.

5. **Limit Work-in-Progress**: Focus on 1-2 tasks at a time to maintain flow.

6. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank present you for good documentation.

7. **Use Claude as a Sounding Board**: When stuck, explaining the problem often reveals the solution.

## First Steps to Take

1. Set up GitHub Projects board
2. Schedule your first sprint planning session
3. Create a sprint calendar with all Scrum events
4. Prepare your development environment
5. Review the initial product backlog we created

Remember that Scrum is meant to be adapted to your needs. As a solo developer, you have the flexibility to modify the framework while maintaining its core principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
