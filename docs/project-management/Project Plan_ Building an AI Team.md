I would love to use a new feature called Claude Code to write the code for the app.

 Here is the workflow I am planning on setting up and how I want to work alongside Claude to get this all done. 

1\. Start new Project in Cluade \- Projects are a great resource in Claude, they allow us to connect our github repo to the project so Claude has access to all our code, and also knowledge docs and instructions to add even more context. In my experience the more you load Claude up with knowledge documents and instructions the more accurate the output and the efficiency improvements are amazing. 2\. Use our project for more high level planning and strategy. Resoning: similar to this conversation where we discuss features and planning at a strategic level, I want our project conversations to maintain the role of product manager (focused on product market fit) and systems architect. I can provide the questions and direction from more of a product manager / product-market fit mindset while you help provide guardrails and strategic planning from a systems architect viewpoint with an eye on security as well. 3\. We use our strategy sessions to develop contintuity of ideas, strategy and execution,and then you write and compose the tehcnical documentation that we will feed into Claude code. Resoning: by seperating planning / strategy and code composition into seperate ecosystems we will use each tool to execute their most effective processes Claude for strategy and creation of technical documentation and Claude code for nothing but creating code off of our technical documentaiotn. 4\. The goal of this execution plan is to stream line efficencies and make sure we have clear dileniation between our strategy mode and execution mode.

please provide feedback on this plan and suggest any opportunities you notice to improve upon it

Your plan for leveraging Claude and Claude Code is quite thoughtful\! I think you've identified a smart workflow that plays to the strengths of each tool. Here's my feedback and some enhancement suggestions:

### **Strengths of Your Plan**

1. **Separation of concerns** \- Keeping strategic planning and code generation as separate workflows makes perfect sense. It allows each tool to focus on what it does best.  
2. **Knowledge-rich context** \- Loading Claude with documentation, planning artifacts, and GitHub code is an excellent approach. Context richness dramatically improves output quality.  
3. **Clear role delineation** \- Having Claude serve as systems architect while you guide as product manager creates a balanced partnership with complementary perspectives.

### **Enhancement Opportunities**

1. **Iterative Feedback Loops** \- Consider adding explicit review cycles between strategy and execution. For example:  
   * Strategy session → Technical docs → Claude Code implementation → Review results → Refine strategy  
   * This ensures lessons from implementation feed back into strategy  
2. **Technical Documentation Templates** \- Create standardized templates for the technical documentation you'll feed to Claude Code. This ensures consistency in how requirements are communicated and reduces ambiguity.  
3. **Versioning Strategy** \- Since you're connecting to GitHub, implement a clear versioning strategy for both documentation and code. This helps track which version of requirements led to which implementation.  
4. **Shared Glossary** \- Develop a consistent terminology set that both you and Claude use across all interactions. This reduces miscommunication and ensures concepts maintain their meaning.  
5. **Testing Framework Planning** \- Include test planning in your strategy sessions. Define what success looks like before implementation begins.  
6. **Regular Architecture Reviews** \- Schedule dedicated sessions focused solely on reviewing architectural decisions to ensure they remain sound as the product evolves.

I think your approach is solid. The key will be maintaining consistency between the strategy conversations and the technical documentation that feeds into Claude Code. Clear, explicit technical requirements with appropriate context will help Claude Code generate the most effective implementations.
