## Sprint Backlog

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Story Points | Notes |
|----|------------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| US-001 | Basic Game Engine Setup | • Project initialized with proper folder structure<br>• Game loop implemented<br>• Rendering pipeline established<br>• Basic asset loading system working<br>• Simple physics/movement engine functional | 5 | Will use Phaser.js with React integration |
| US-002 | Player Character and Movement | • Character rendered on screen<br>• Character responds to keyboard input<br>• Character animation for idle and movement states<br>• Character collides with environment boundaries<br>• Simple camera following the character | 3 | Start with simple character sprite |
| US-003 | Game World Environment | • First game level "Command Center" designed and rendered<br>• Environmental objects are properly placed<br>• Collision detection with environment objects works<br>• Visual indicators for interactive objects | 5 | Focus on functional layout first, polish later |
| US-004 | Game State Management | • Game state can be initialized<br>• State transitions work properly<br>• Player progress is tracked<br>• Game state can be saved/loaded | 3 | Core foundation for game progression |
| US-005 | Basic Code Editor | • Code editor component renders in the UI<br>• Basic syntax highlighting<br>• Text input and editing functionality<br>• Code can be submitted for evaluation<br>• Basic error highlighting | 8 | Research existing libraries first |

## Sprint Velocity
Planned Story Points: 24
Previous Sprint Velocity: N/A (First Sprint)

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Integration of Phaser.js with React might be challenging
  - **Mitigation**: Research and prototype a simple integration first, dedicate first 1-2 days to this
- **Risk**: Code editor implementation could take longer than expected
  - **Mitigation**: Explore existing libraries like CodeMirror or Monaco Editor rather than building from scratch
- **Risk**: Asset creation/sourcing might delay development
  - **Mitigation**: Use placeholder assets initially, focus on functionality first

## Definition of "Done"
- Code is written, documented, and committed to GitHub
- Basic unit tests pass (where applicable)
- Feature is functional in local development environment
- All acceptance criteria are verified
- Code has been reviewed (either by pair programming or post-implementation review)
- No known high-priority bugs or issues
