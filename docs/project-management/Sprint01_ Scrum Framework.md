Sprint01: Scrum Framework

1. ### **Scrum Framework for CodeQuest**

1. **Roles**:  
   * **Product Owner**: You would serve in this role, focusing on vision, priorities, and product-market fit  
   * **Scrum Master**: Claude could help simulate this role by keeping strategy sessions focused and identifying impediments  
   * **Development Team**: This would be you as the implementer, with Claude Code assisting in development  
2. **Artifacts**:  
   * **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and fixes  
   * **Sprint Backlog**: Items selected for the current sprint  
   * **Increment**: Working software produced during each sprint  
3. **Events**:  
   * **Sprint Planning**: At the beginning of each sprint (suggest 1-2 week sprints for your timeline)  
   * **Daily Scrum**: Brief check-ins on progress (can be simulated through regular interactions)  
   * **Sprint Review**: Demo and evaluate what was completed  
   * **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on the process and identify improvements

### **II. Implementation Plan**

Let's create a practical implementation of Scrum for your project:

1. **Initial Product Backlog Creation**:  
   * Use our roadmap as a starting point  
   * Break down features into specific user stories  
   * Prioritize based on value and dependencies  
   * Estimate complexity/effort for each item  
2. **Sprint Structure**:  
   * 1-week sprints to start (good for your 2-4 week MVP timeline)  
   * First sprint focused on core engine and basic AI assistant integration  
   * Clear definition of "Done" for each item  
3. **Coordination**:  
   * Begin each Claude session with a brief "daily scrum" update  
   * Record decisions and action items in a structured format  
   * Track progress visually (perhaps using GitHub Projects)  
4. **Documentation Templates**:  
   * User Story template for Product Backlog items  
   * Technical Specification template for Claude Code inputs  
   * Sprint Review template to document progress

This approach would give you practical experience with Scrum while maintaining the strategic/tactical separation you outlined. The short sprints would help maintain focus and provide regular opportunities to inspect and adapt both the product and process.

Would you like me to create some Scrum templates and help set up an initial Product Backlog based on our existing roadmap?
