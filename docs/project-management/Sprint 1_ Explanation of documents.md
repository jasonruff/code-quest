Sprint 1: Explanation of Documents

Purpose: The Explanation of Documents document helps share important information and foundational project documentation across teams and will be loaded into each project team's Project Knowledge documentation.  All updates and changes will be shared across all teams at intervals determined by the Project Management team.

1. **Project Roadmap (roadmap.md)**: A detailed, phased approach from MVP to scaling, with clear milestones and success metrics.  
2. **AI Assistant Design (ai-assistant-design.md)**: Complete character concept for "Byte," your in-game AI companion, with personality traits, technical implementation details, and interaction patterns.  
3. **Technical Architecture (tech.architecture(v2).mermaid)**: A visual diagram showing how all components will work together, emphasizing the AI integration points.  
4. **Game Interface Mockup (game-interface-mockup.html)**: A visual prototype of what the game will look like, showing the coding interface and Byte's appearance.  
5. **Implementation Plan (mvp-implementation-plan(v2).md)**: A week-by-week breakdown of tasks for your 2-4 week MVP development period.  
6. **AI Integration Code (ai-assistant-code(v5).js)**: Practical code example showing how to implement the AI teaching assistant using an LLM API.
