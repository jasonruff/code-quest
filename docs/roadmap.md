# CodeQuest: Educational Coding Game Roadmap

## Project Vision
Build an educational RPG game that teaches coding concepts through engaging gameplay, featuring an AI teaching assistant that provides personalized guidance and support.

## Phase 1: MVP (2-4 Weeks)

### Game Foundations
- Basic game mechanics (player movement, interaction)
- Simple RPG environment (1-2 locations)
- Core game loop (receive mission → solve coding puzzle → progress story)
- 3-5 introductory coding challenges teaching fundamental concepts
- Basic progress tracking

### AI Teaching Assistant (v1)
- Character design and personality
- Integration with LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Contextual hint system based on common errors
- Celebratory responses for successful solutions
- Basic error detection and guidance

### Technical Foundation
- Select game framework (Phaser.js, React + Canvas, etc.)
- Core architecture design with extensibility in mind
- Basic user authentication and progress saving
- Deployment pipeline for quick iterations

### MVP Success Metrics
- Players can complete the initial tutorial level
- AI assistant can provide relevant hints for common errors
- Players report positive learning experience in basic testing
- Technical foundation supports future extensions

## Phase 2: Enhancement (1-2 Months)

### Game Expansion
- Additional game environments (3-5 total)
- Expanded story and mission structure
- 10-15 additional coding challenges with increasing complexity
- Character customization options
- Achievement system

### AI Teaching Assistant (v2)
- Improved contextual awareness of player's history
- Multiple explanation styles based on player preferences
- Code suggestions that maintain educational value
- Personality refinement based on user feedback
- Integration with player analytics

### Technical Improvements
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced analytics for learning patterns
- Improved code validation system
- Cloud saving and multi-device support

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 Months)

### Adaptive Learning System
- Difficulty adjustment based on player performance
- Custom learning paths
- Challenge recommendation engine

### Multiplayer Elements
- Collaborative coding challenges
- Code sharing and showcasing
- Leaderboards and friendly competition

### AI Teaching Assistant (v3)
- Natural language code translation features
- Complex pattern recognition in player approaches
- Proactive suggestions based on learning patterns
- Multiple AI characters with different teaching styles

### Monetization Strategy
- Premium content packages
- Subscription model for advanced features
- Classroom/enterprise licensing options

## Phase 4: Scaling (3+ Months)

### Content Expansion
- Multiple subject domains (beyond basic coding)
- Advanced coding challenges for experienced users
- Regular content updates and seasonal events

### Community Building
- User-generated challenges
- Community forums and support
- Developer API for extensions

### AI Evolution
- Procedural content generation for infinite challenges
- Highly personalized learning experiences
- Integration with real-world coding environments

## Technology Stack Considerations

### Frontend
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React for UI components
- Game engine: Phaser.js or Three.js
- Responsive design for multiple devices

### Backend
- Node.js or Python
- Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- Authentication system
- Analytics pipeline

### AI Components
- LLM integration: OpenAI API or Anthropic Claude
- Custom prompt engineering
- Context management system
- Analytics for AI performance improvement

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Create paper prototype of game concept and basic flow
2. Design first 3 coding challenges with clear learning objectives
3. Sketch AI assistant character and define personality traits
4. Set up development environment and basic project structure
5. Create minimal game engine proof of concept
6. Implement basic LLM integration for assistant responses
7. Test initial prototype with 3-5 potential users
