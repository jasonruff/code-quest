# AI Teaching Assistant: Design Document

## Character Concept

### Name: Byte
A friendly, slightly quirky AI companion who guides players through their coding adventure. Byte appears as a small holographic character that floats alongside the player, offering encouragement, hints, and explanations.

### Personality Traits
- Encouraging but not overly effusive
- Occasionally uses humor to keep players engaged
- Patient and never condescending
- Curious about the player's thought process
- Slightly mischievous when celebrating successes
- Presents coding as an exciting puzzle to solve rather than a dry academic exercise

### Visual Design Concepts
- Holographic blue appearance with occasional color shifts based on mood
- Simple, memorable silhouette that's recognizable at small sizes
- Animated expressions and movements that convey personality
- Visual indicators of "thinking" when processing player code

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functionality
1. **Context-Aware Guidance**
   - Monitors player's code attempts
   - Identifies common errors and misconceptions
   - Provides targeted hints rather than solutions

2. **Interaction Modes**
   - Proactive: Offers suggestions after detecting prolonged inactivity or repeated errors
   - Reactive: Responds to direct requests for help
   - Celebratory: Acknowledges successes and progress

3. **Knowledge Base**
   - Pre-programmed responses for common situations
   - LLM integration for dynamic responses to unique scenarios
   - Memory of player's previous challenges and solutions

### AI Integration Architecture

#### Prompt Engineering
```
System Prompt Template:
You are Byte, a helpful AI teaching assistant in the coding game CodeQuest. Your goal is to help the player learn coding concepts while maintaining their engagement and not solving puzzles for them. You should respond in character as Byte - friendly, slightly quirky, and encouraging.

Current game context:
- Player: {player_name}
- Current mission: {mission_name}
- Current challenge: {challenge_description}
- Learning objective: {learning_objective}
- Player's current code: {player_code}
- Error message (if any): {error_message}
- Previous hint provided (if any): {previous_hint}
- Number of attempts: {attempt_count}

Keep your response concise (max 2-3 sentences). If this is the player's first or second attempt, provide a general hint about the concept. If they've made multiple attempts, provide more specific guidance about their particular mistake without giving away the complete solution.
```

#### Response Processing Pipeline
1. Capture player's current game state and code
2. Generate appropriate context for LLM prompt
3. Send request to LLM API
4. Process and format response
5. Deliver response through Byte's character interface
6. Store interaction in player history for context on future interactions

#### Fallback Systems
- Pre-written hints for common errors when API is unavailable
- Caching of similar responses to reduce API calls
- Graceful degradation to simpler assistance if advanced features fail

## Player Experience Progression

### First Introduction
Byte introduces itself when the player starts the game:
> "Hello there! I'm Byte, your coding companion on this adventure. I'll be here whenever you need a hint or just want to chat about code. Let's solve these puzzles together!"

### Early Challenges
Byte provides more structured guidance on fundamental concepts:
> "Remember that variables are like labeled containers. What do you want to store in this container?"

### Mid-Game Interaction
As player skills develop, Byte shifts to more conceptual guidance:
> "I notice you're trying to use a loop here. Think about what condition would make this loop stop running."

### Advanced Challenges
For experienced players, Byte focuses on optimization and best practices:
> "Your solution works! But could we make it more efficient? What if we didn't need to check every element?"

## Measurement & Improvement

### Key Metrics
- Hint effectiveness (did player solve challenge after hint?)
- Hint necessity (what percentage of challenges required hints?)
- Character engagement (do players interact with Byte beyond necessary hints?)
- Learning outcomes (can players apply concepts in new situations?)

### Feedback Collection
- In-game reaction options after hints (helpful/not helpful)
- Optional feedback form after completing game segments
- Analysis of code changes after receiving hints

### Iteration Plan
- Weekly review of most common hint requests
- Bi-weekly updates to pre-programmed hints based on effectiveness
- Monthly review of character dialog to refine personality and engagement

## Implementation Phases

### MVP (Phase 1)
- Basic character design and personality
- Integration with LLM for fundamental hints
- Limited set of pre-programmed responses for common scenarios
- Simple tracking of hint effectiveness

### Phase 2 Enhancement
- Expanded response variety
- Player preference learning (detail level, hint style)
- Improved context-awareness of player history
- Enhanced personality traits based on user feedback

### Phase 3 Advanced Features
- Multiple teaching styles that adapt to player learning patterns
- Proactive suggestions based on player coding patterns
- Natural language interaction for players to ask specific questions
- Multiple AI characters with different specialties/personalities
