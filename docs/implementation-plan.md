- [ ] Set up basic project scaffolding
- [ ] Create simple "Hello World" test to verify setup

### Days 3-5: Core Game Structure
- [ ] Implement basic game state management system
- [ ] Create game loop and rendering pipeline
- [ ] Build simple character movement mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement minimal UI framework
- [ ] Create first game environment (command center)

**Weekend Review**: Verify that the basic game engine is working correctly and ready for content implementation.

## Week 2: Game Content & Code Editor

### Days 1-2: Code Editor Implementation
- [ ] Build code editor component with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Create code execution and validation system
- [ ] Implement basic error detection
- [ ] Build success/failure feedback system

### Days 3-5: First Tutorial Mission
- [ ] Create "Security Initialization" mission flow
- [ ] Design and implement mission dialogue system

- [ ] Implement mission progression logic

**Weekend Review**: Play through the first mission and verify that the code editor works correctly.

## Week 3: AI Assistant Implementation

### Days 1-2: Assistant Backend
- [ ] Set up Claude API integration (Anthropic)
- [ ] Build context management system
- [ ] Create prompt engineering templates
- [ ] Implement response processing pipeline
- [ ] Create basic caching system to reduce API calls

### Days 3-5: Assistant Frontend & Character
- [ ] Design and implement Byte's character visuals
- [ ] Create assistant UI and animation system
- [ ] Build dialogue display system
- [ ] Implement user interaction with assistant
- [ ] Create fallback responses for common scenarios

**Weekend Review**: Test AI assistant interactions across different player inputs and scenarios.

## Week 4: Polishing & User Testing

### Days 1-2: Additional Game Content
- [ ] Create second tutorial mission ("Logic Gates")
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality
- [ ] Build progress tracking system
- [ ] Add basic achievements

### Days 3-4: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Conduct internal playtesting
- [ ] Refine AI assistant responses based on testing
- [ ] Fix identified bugs and issues
- [ ] Optimize performance for target platforms

### Day 5: MVP Release Preparation
- [ ] Create deployment pipeline
- [ ] Prepare simple landing page
- [ ] Set up basic analytics to capture user data
- [ ] Finalize documentation
- [ ] Deploy MVP for limited user testing
