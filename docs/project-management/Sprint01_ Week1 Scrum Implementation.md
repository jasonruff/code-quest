I'd be happy to provide specific implementation suggestions to get you started with Scrum for your CodeQuest project\!

## **First Week Implementation Plan**

### **Day 1: Environment Setup**

1. **Create GitHub Repository**  
   * Set up a new repository for CodeQuest  
   * Initialize with a README that includes your project vision  
   * Add a .gitignore appropriate for JavaScript/React projects  
2. **Set Up GitHub Projects Board**  
   * Create a new project using the Board template  
   * Add the columns: Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done  
   * Import the initial product backlog items as cards  
3. **Project Documentation**  
   * Create a "docs" folder in your repository  
   * Add the Scrum templates we created  
   * Create a project wiki page with your game concept and architecture

### **Day 2: First Sprint Planning Session**

1. **Backlog Refinement**  
   * Review the product backlog we created  
   * Ensure you understand all the user stories  
   * Verify that the first few stories are detailed enough to work on  
2. **Sprint Planning**  
   * Use the Sprint Planning template  
   * Fill in concrete dates for the sprint  
   * Review and confirm the sprint goal  
   * Commit to the stories in Sprint 1  
3. **Technical Planning**  
   * Create a Claude Project and link your GitHub repository  
   * Upload our technical architecture diagram and AI assistant design  
   * Have a planning session about the technical approach for US-001

### **Day 3-6: Sprint Execution**

1. **Daily Rhythm**  
   * Begin each day with a 5-minute self-standup using the Daily Scrum template  
   * Focus on 1-2 tasks at a time  
   * Move cards across your board as you progress  
   * End each day with a brief reflection and plan for tomorrow  
2. **Development Flow with Claude Code**  
   * Start with US-001: Basic Game Engine Setup  
   * Create a detailed technical specification using our templates  
   * Submit this to Claude Code to generate the initial framework  
   * Review, test, and refine the code  
3. **Tracking Progress**  
   * Update GitHub issues with progress comments  
   * Create a simple burndown chart in a spreadsheet  
   * Take screenshots or notes about completed work for the sprint review

### **Day 7: Sprint Review and Retrospective**

1. **Sprint Review**  
   * Use the Sprint Review template  
   * Document what was completed versus planned  
   * Demo the completed features to yourself (record a video if helpful)  
   * Update your product backlog based on insights gained  
2. **Sprint Retrospective**  
   * Use the Retrospective template  
   * Honestly assess what went well and what could be improved  
   * Create 2-3 actionable improvements for the next sprint  
   * Schedule your next sprint planning session

## **Practical Tips for Your First Week**

1. **Start Small**  
   * Focus on getting US-001 working perfectly before moving to other stories  
   * A working foundation is critical for the rest of the project  
2. **Structured Claude Interactions**  
   * Create separate conversations for different purposes:  
     * One for sprint planning and daily standups  
     * Another for technical discussions on specific user stories  
     * A third for retrospectives and project improvement  
3. **Claude Code Efficiency**  
   * Be extremely specific in your requests to Claude Code  
   * Include code structure, naming conventions, and error handling expectations  
   * Review generated code carefully, looking for edge cases  
4. **Balancing Planning and Doing**  
   * Aim for 20% planning, 80% doing  
   * Don't over-perfect your process \- adjust as you go  
   * Remember that delivering working software is the primary measure of progress  
5. **Artifact Management**  
   * Keep all Scrum artifacts in your GitHub repository  
   * Update your README with links to important documents  
   * Consider creating a simple development journal to track decisions

“Would you like more specific guidance on any of these aspects, or are there particular challenges you anticipate that I could help address?”

“This looks awesome, what is my next action item?”

"Your next immediate action item is to create your GitHub repository and set up the GitHub Projects board.”

Specifically:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for CodeQuest  
   * Name it something like "codequest" or "code-quest"  
   * Initialize it with a README.md  
   * Add an appropriate .gitignore file for JavaScript/React projects  
2. In that repository, set up GitHub Projects  
   * Create a new project with the Board template  
   * Set up columns: Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done  
   * Begin adding your initial product backlog items

Clone the repository to your local machine and set up the basic folder structure:  
 Copy  
/docs         (for project documentation)  
/src          (for source code)  
/assets       (for game assets)

3. /design       (for mockups and design documents)

4. Add the Scrum templates we created to your docs folder

Once you've completed these steps, you'll have the basic infrastructure in place to begin your first sprint planning session. This will give you a concrete foundation to start implementing the Scrum methodology while you work on your game.

Would you like any guidance on setting up the GitHub repository or projects board?
